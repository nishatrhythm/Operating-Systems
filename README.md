# Assignment
Develop a shell script that simplifies the process of managing files and directories. This script automates common tasks like moving or renaming files, creating new directories, and deleting old files. It provides a basic yet effective solution for organizing and manipulating file systems efficiently.

<h2><b>Features</b></h2>

<h3>Menu System</h3>
Create a simple menu-driven interface that presents users with options for file and directory management tasks.

<h3>File Operations</h3>
<b>Move Files:</b>
Allow users to move files from one directory to another by specifying the source and destination paths.<br>
<b>Rename Files:</b>
Enable users to rename files by providing the current name and the desired new name.

<h3>Directory Operations</h3>
<b>Create Directories:</b>
Allow users to create new directories by specifying the directory name and the parent directory (if applicable).<br>
<b>Delete Directories:</b>
Provide an option to delete existing directories, ensuring confirmation before removal.

<h3>File Deletion</h3>
<b>Delete Files:</b>
Allow users to delete specific files by specifying the file name or path.<br>
<b>Delete Old Files:</b>
Implement a feature to delete files that haven't been accessed for a specified period.

<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<b>Basic Error Handling:</b>
Include basic error handling mechanisms to handle common errors like invalid inputs or file not found.<br>
<b>Informative Messages:</b>
Provide informative error messages to guide users in resolving issues encountered during script execution.

<h3>Input Validation</h3>
<b>Simple Input Validation:</b>
Validate user inputs to ensure they are not empty or contain invalid characters.
